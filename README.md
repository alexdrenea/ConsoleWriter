# Console Writer

The `ConsoleWriter` library exposes some Console.Write extensions that allow you to have a nicer looking output from your methods by using colors (There are libraries out there that specialize in this and you can definitely use one of those, but if all you require is simple color you can certanly stick with what's offered here')
